# coding_examples
Here there are some examples of my coding skills.
Some of them are computationally inefficient because I was at the very start of my coding path.
There are also some pictures from my time at the university journals, mostly plots used in articles and instagram posts.
- Script_TripAdvisor_Scrape: I scraped all the restaurants in a number of selected cities in tripadvisor Italy, this script would return around 60k e-mails. It has been very useful to get a view of restaurant and conduct a small research on restaurant tastes for an extra curricular project. (pandas, beautiful soup, etc.)
- framework_insta_plot: I used this script as a baseline for all the instagram posts for the University Journal. (matplotlib, pandas)
- exploring_variables_thesis: Used to make analysis on the dataset (microdata of household income in Italy from 2008-2020) used on my thesis. (pandas, statsmodels)
- scraping orbis dataset: used to automatically download datapoints from the Orbis IP. (Selenium, pandas)
